  - "Avarice called to you. It whispered the name of St John\u2019s Mercy hospital,
    and you obeyed down to a tee. Before the total collapse of society this was one
    of the main crisis and evacuation points that the government had taken hold at
    in your city."
  - "Now it\u2019s a place of total outbreak. The infected are the dominant species
    in these wards, and they chase you all about, to-and-fro, preventing you from
    actually scavenging for supplies or even really getting a lay of the place."
  - In the end, you barely escape without a scratch, but you also gain nothing as
    a result. You walk away empty-handed, but at least you live.
