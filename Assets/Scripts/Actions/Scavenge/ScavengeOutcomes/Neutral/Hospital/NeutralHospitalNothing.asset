  - "A need for supplies sends you to try the hospital. It\u2019s a massive set of
    buildings, each a ward of sorts. During the initial outbreak, this hospital also
    doubled as a military outpost and a government-issued safe zone, quarantine,
    and evacuation point. There is incredible loot here, but also incredible danger."
  - You make your way through the general clinic sections of the hospital, keeping
    a low profile. In the pursuit of safety and caution, you sacrifice too much time
    hiding and avoiding profitable areas.
  - "By the time you have to go back, you find yourself particularly empty-handed.
    At least you didn\u2019t hurt yourself, however."
