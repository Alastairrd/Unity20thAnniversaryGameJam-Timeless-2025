  - "The St John\u2019s Mercy Hospital Evacuation Centre is an excellent place to
    die trying to get some supplies. It is chock-full of military surplus, medical
    goods, government rations, and undead beasts."
  - You took to exploring the place in hopes of getting some good loot, and what
    you found was an incredible amount of danger. A little medicine here, an attack
    from behind there, a dart from a horde at one point leads to a split second of
    opportunity to bag some materials from a storeroom.
  - By the end of your expedition, you come away with pain and a good amount of supplies.
    Hopefully this was all worth it.
