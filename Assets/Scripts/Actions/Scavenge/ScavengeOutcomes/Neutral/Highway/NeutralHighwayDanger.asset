  - "Despite the risks, you decidedly took a chance on the nearby highway. The vehicle
    pileups along there are good places for finding supplies\u2014especially fuel.
    You meander between abandoned vehicles, falling into a lull from the rhythm of
    fuel siphoning and dashboard looting."
  - Along the way, you spy a vehicle with some life in it. Surprised, you look inside
    only to be greeted by a fellow survivor lying across the passenger seat cushions.
    The survivor within rises beneath their blanket to meet your peering eyes behind
    the cabin window.
  - "Surprise fills their eyes, making them wide and panicked. Before you can defuse
    their worries or take advantage of them, the survivor draws something metallic
    from beneath their seat, and you barely have time to register the barrel of a
    gun before it\u2019s firing at you."
  - "You duck out of the way, the fine shatter of the port window raining along your
    back. You make a run down the highway, weaving between cars until you feel like
    you\u2019re far out of her range."
  - Somewhere in your escape, you lose your finds. At least you are unharmed, but
    you have gained nothing from this venture.
