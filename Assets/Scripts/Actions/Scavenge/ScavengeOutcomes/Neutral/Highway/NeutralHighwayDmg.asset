  <messages>k__BackingField:
  - "The nearest highway was your choice for expedition this time. You spend an hour
    peering into cars, smashing windows looking for something decent. Cars aren\u2019t
    exactly good sources of loot however, but what was tantalising was the locked
    up semi-trailer with a big HEINZ logo on its side."
  - "You figure the front cabin of the semi-truck ought to have a key to the heavy
    lock on the trailer doors. You make your way to the driver\u2019s seat and mount
    the steps to the door, only to find the driver still in his seat, dead and slumped
    in his seatbelt."
  - "The stench and the morbidity doesn\u2019t deter you still from reaching round
    to his dashboard. You rifle about until you find a key, and as you withdraw the
    corpse of the late driver comes to life and begins gnawing into your shoulder. "
  - "It takes a lot to pull away, but you do, landing butt first in the asphalt whilst
    the undead driver thrashes away in its seatbelt. The landing hurt more than this
    gumless idiot\u2019s attempts at chewing through your sinew. You stand up and
    walk back to your spoils."
