  - Your scavenging takes you to an empty residential district. Copy-pasted terraced
    houses stand at attention on either side of the asphalt. The thin walkways on
    either side of the street serve as the only shared porch for every tenant that
    used to inhabit this urban zone.
  - You try your luck with whatever housing unit you could gain access to. You find
    yourself a neat haul in one rather untouched house. Rifling through the cupboards
    still stocked with canned goodies, you almost wonder to yourself why no one has
    had any luck with this space.
  - "That\u2019s when a shuffling from behind you spins you on your heels. It\u2019s
    too late though, an emaciated corpse has gotten the jump on you. Bony arms reach
    out and grab at your shoulders, the intention being to bring the flesh of your
    face and neck into its nasty, pus-drooling mouth. "
  - "Rotting teeth bare inches from your face. Your arms rise to guard your face,
    and those teeth sink into your arm, piercing flesh, drawing blood. You scream
    from the sheer pain, and with the time you\u2019ve gained in sacrificing your
    arm, you draw your knife and perform a free lobotomy on the attacking corpse-walker.
    It crumples in a fit of spasm, leaving you with your spoils and your injuries
    alike."
