  - "Walking down an open street, you find\u2026 nothing, but someone up in a nearby
    high-rise seems to have found you."
  - You know this from the unmistakable crack of gunshot, followed by the whizz of
    a whiffed bullet speeding by your ear. You duck low, scrambling behind a waist-high
    transformer just in time for another shot to kick up the concrete right where
    you ought to have been only a microsecond ago.
  - A couple more attempts at your life are had before silence leaves you to enjoy
    your tinnitus. You sit there, back pressed into the dirty, graffitied steel plating
    of the urban box. Terror prevents you from moving for a whole hour, and only
    then do you even dare peak your head out to see if your assailant was still there.
  - Maybe he left 15 minutes ago, maybe he left the instant he stopped shooting.
    Whatever the case, you were finally ok to get mobile again, and all that cost
    was an hour of your day.
  - You gain nothing, you lose nothing.
