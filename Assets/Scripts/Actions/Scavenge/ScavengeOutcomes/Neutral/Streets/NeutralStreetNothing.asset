  <messages>k__BackingField:
  - Exploring some blocks nearby, you find a walk-up apartment with its front door
    hanging off loose hinges. You approach the doorway on a whim, and the apparent
    lack of corpse-stench from within tempts you to at least check out the first
    floor and its domiciles.
  - You find nothing much besides the telltale signs that an indefinite amount of
    people have been looting about before you even laid eyes on this place. You find
    empty drawers, empty pantries, and even the closets and bureaus have been picked
    clean.
  - "It\u2019s not all hopeless for you though. Within the thick layer of dust on
    the floor you spy a lone box of painkillers (+1 meds). Someone must have dropped
    whilst in the midst of a big haul. You pocket this and head back out to the streets."
