  - Your feet take you to the Market District, where the loot abounds but the price
    tends to be heavy. These were the most populated spots in the city, both by other
    scavengers and the undead alike.
  - "You try to keep a low profile exploring this area, dredging up scraps of supplies
    wherever you can. You get a little greedy though, trying your luck in a 3-storey
    department store on a high street. Here is where you meet with the eternal shoppers
    of Men\u2019s section."
  - "Stumbling onto the swarm, you are unable to keep from being unnoticed. They
    begin their descent upon you, charging through display bins and knocking over
    aisles in their frenzy for some sustenance. It\u2019s a loud clatter, drawing
    the ire of any hordes you had successfully bypassed in trying to get this deep
    into the shopping centre."
  - "You\u2019d make it out alive, but not without hurting yourself a bunch and getting
    all knackered. At least you didn\u2019t lose anything in your flight from the
    premise. Hopefully, what you\u2019ve managed to gain at least makes up for the
    scuffle you\u2019ve endured in this exploration."
