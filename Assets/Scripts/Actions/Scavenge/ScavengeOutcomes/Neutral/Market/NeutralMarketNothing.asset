  - "Market districts were the first places to be looted when order fell. They are
    still the number one hotspot for meeting fellow scavengers and undead alike\u2014at
    least outside of actual buildings like malls and hospitals. "
  - "You decided to take your chances in a place like this, avarice guiding you like
    the lull of a mermaid\u2019s song. There are always safer zones to try at, but
    none will give you nearly as many potential finds as a street with as many hardware
    stores as there are pharmacies."
  - "It\u2019s not a bad exploration at first. Your meandering permanently opened
    storefronts and hidden urban corridors keeps you off the main streets. You don\u2019t
    really end up finding much, just dead bodies picked clean down to their jackets
    sometimes."
  - "You had a safe expedition through the Markets, but you don\u2019t find anything
    either. You head home virtually empty-handed."
