  - You try your luck at the High Streets. You put on your backpack and set off in
    a good mood.
  - You make it about 30 meters from your outpost before a fellow Scav is trying
    to press a knife into your throat.
  - "It\u2019s a struggle that\u2019s not in your favour, given that the Scav had
    gotten the jump on you. He plunges the knife into your shoulder and you headbutt
    him to clear some space."
  - "The trade isn\u2019t fair, but at least you finally had some means of worming
    from out of his reach. You take to disappearing in a nearby underpass and spend
    the rest of your time patching yourself up. "
