  - 'You take to the streets for your scavenging. '
  - "The urban roads wind you round to a residential that\u2019s been repurposed
    by some community of survivors."
  - "You try to approach the makeshift gate they\u2019ve set up across the thin residential
    road and the guard stationed there fires at you without warning."
  - His projectile nicks you and sends you running. You spend the rest of the time
    licking your wounds.
