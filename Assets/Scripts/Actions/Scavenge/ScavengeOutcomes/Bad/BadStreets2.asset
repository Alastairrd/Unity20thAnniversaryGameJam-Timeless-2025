  - The streets around your hideout are your chosen hunting grounds this time. You
    try the alleyways, hoping these urban corridors will be safer than the open streets
    in terms of hiding you from general hordes.
  - "Too bad the infected didn\u2019t get any memo. They stand about in dark corners
    and up above on awnings and external fire escapes. They spot you in a heartbeat
    and descend on you in seconds."
  - You barely escape with your life, but not without its own costs.
