  - You take to the streets for your scav run.
  - "It\u2019s relatively uneventful, till you find yourself crossing paths with
    a lone scavenger who tries their best to see you impaled on their sharpened stick."
  - "It takes a lot of your attention, but you manage to defend yourself, even turning
    your assailant\u2019s own weapon onto themselves, effectively ending their bandit
    career for good."
  - "Death is an unfortunate outcome, but what isn\u2019t unfortunate is the nice
    spread of materials you gained from his corpse. You stomp his head clean in so
    he doesn\u2019t return either. Consider that community service."
