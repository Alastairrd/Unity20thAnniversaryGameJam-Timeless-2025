  - Exploration of a nearby street takes you to a hardware store, where you manage
    to get a bunch of tools and materials before a roaming band of brigands begins
    to filter into the store.
  - "You slip out the back and use the alleyway behind the store to return to your
    hideout. It\u2019s a detour, and ends up being the rest of your expedition."
