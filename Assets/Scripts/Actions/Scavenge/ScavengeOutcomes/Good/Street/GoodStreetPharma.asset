  - 'Exploration of a nearby street takes you to a pharmacy, where a small bandit
    outpost has taken fort. '
  - "You were drawn to the area by the sounds of scuffle. When you got there you
    found the bandits fighting off another band of raiders. It\u2019s a bloody scene,
    and chaotic too. "
  - The fighting had driven everyone out of the store itself and onto the streets,
    so you decide to take your chance at sneaking into the pharmacy and try stealing
    the supplies of the bandits.
  - You have little trouble on entry, and you take your fill of medicines and foods,
    stuffing your bag full before leaving the same way you came in.
  - "A great haul today, and you didn\u2019t even have to use your makeshift weapons.
    Today was a good day."
