  - "You decide to give the streets around your hideout an explore. It\u2019s emptier
    than you\u2019ve ever seen it, but for once that\u2019s a good thing."
  - You manage to scrounge a whole lot of materials without getting into any trouble.
    Sometimes, Luck is on your side, and you take her opportunity by the fistful
