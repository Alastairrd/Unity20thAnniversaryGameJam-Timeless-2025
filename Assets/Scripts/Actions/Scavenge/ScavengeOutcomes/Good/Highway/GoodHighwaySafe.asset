  - You take to the nearby highway for your next expedition. Such a place is dangerous
    for how little reward it gives, but sometimes you can get nice hauls from abandoned
    semi-trailers and roadside establishments.
  - 'This expedition finds you something a little interesting though. Rather than
    a semi-trailer or a petrol station, you find the aftermath of a bloody scuffle
    between what looks like two survivor groups. '
  - "It\u2019s hard to tell what happened, and who was on who\u2019s side, but what
    you can tell is that you\u2019re one of the first to the scene of carnage\u2014even
    getting here before the infected\u2014so you better make the most of your fortune."
  - "You run each man\u2019s pockets and backpacks as best as you can, then leave."
