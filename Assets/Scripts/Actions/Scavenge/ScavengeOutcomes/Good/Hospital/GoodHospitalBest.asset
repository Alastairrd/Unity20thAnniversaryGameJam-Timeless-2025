  - You decide to scavenge your hospital for your next expedition. Being the main
    crisis and evacuation point for your city before its total collapse, it was chalk
    full of both loot and danger.
  - "You make your entry through the front-facing wards, finding it relatively empty
    for its locale. Gunshots in the distance give you a clue as to why. Somebody
    is having a bad day right now, but one man\u2019s bad luck is another\u2019s
    opportunity."
  - With little resistance, you make your way to the nearest pharmacy within the
    general section and begin looting its stores.
  - You make it out safely with a big haul.
