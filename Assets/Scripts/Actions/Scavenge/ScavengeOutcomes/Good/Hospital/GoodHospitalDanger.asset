  - The hospital is your choice of prey. You felt daring, and one of the most dangerous
    looting spots in the city piqued your interest where it would otherwise have
    scared you off.
  - You take your entrance by squeezing under a chain-link fence and make it into
    deep territory. A little exploration leads you to believe this part of the hospital
    was the militaristic part of the evac centre that spawned when the initial outbreak
    started.
  - You hoped to find weapons scavenging the storehouses, but it seems that every
    armoury has already been picked clean of useable guns and munitions. This was
    a shame, but you still find useable parts that could be repurposed in other things.
  - 'You take what you can before a nearby undead notices you through an open window.
    It screeches as it darts for you, getting itself stuck between the windowsill
    and the broken panes. '
  - Dispatching of it is simple, but distant roars tell you that you need to move
    before the true horde gets here.
  - You end up leaving with a good haul and your life intact.
